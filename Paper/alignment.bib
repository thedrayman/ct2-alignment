  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a method for automatically converting raw GPS traces from everyday vehicles into a routable road network. The method begins by smoothing raw GPS traces using a novel aggregation technique. This technique pulls together traces that belong on the same road in response to simulated potential energy wells created around each trace. After the traces are moved in response to the potential fields, they tend to coalesce into smooth paths. To help adjust the parameters of the constituent potential fields, we present a theoretical analysis of the behavior of our algorithm on a few different road configurations. With the resulting smooth traces, we apply a custom clustering algorithm to create a graph of nodes and edges representing the road network. We show how this network can be used to plan reasonable driving routes, much like consumer-oriented mapping Web sites. We demonstrate our algorithms using real GPS data collected on public roads, and we evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing the route planning results suggested by our generated graph to a commercial route planner.},

  Abstract                 = {Instead of traditional ways of creating road maps, an attractive alternative is to create a map based on GPS traces of regular drivers. One important aspect of this approach is to automatically compute the number and locations of driving lanes on a road. We introduce the idea of using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to model the distribution of GPS traces across multiple traffic lanes. The GMM naturally accounts for the inherent spread in GPS data. We present a new variation of the GMM that enforces constant lane width and GPS variance in each lane. For fitting the GMM, we also introduce a new regularizer that is sensitive to the overall spread of the GPS data across the road. Our experiments on real GPS data show that our new GMM is better at counting lanes than a more traditional GMM, and it gives more consistent results across our data set.},
